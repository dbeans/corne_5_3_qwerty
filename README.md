# Dbeans' keymap

## Initial
Keyboard build and configured by https://github.com/anrodfa/

## Planned changes:
* Change symbol layer. Inspiration:
  * symbol map of https://github.com/DesyncTheThird/corne-keymap -> inverted (), [], {} for nicer rolling  
  * https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/symbol-layer/index.html
* Add mouse layer
* Shift is nicely available on both sides, but CTRL and ALT are not very intuitive. Want to try home row mod
  * some combos for cut/copy/paste
* Implement some combos for faster navigation 
  * arrows are bit too hidden
  * how to jump to start/end of line, page up/down
